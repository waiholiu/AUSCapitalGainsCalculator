# Capital Gains Calculator (Australia)

An Angular application that helps users calculate their capital gains tax liability specifically for Australian tax regulations.

## How It Works

Enter your property purchase and sale details, along with your income and that of your spouse (if applicable). The calculator will:
1. Calculate the capital gain from the sale of the property.
2. Apply the 50% Capital Gains Tax (CGT) discount for assets held over 12 months.
3. Estimate the additional tax burden based on your income and your spouse's income.
4. Provide a shareable URL that retains all your input values for easy sharing and future reference.
5. Display a detailed breakdown of the tax impact, including individual and combined analyses for you and your spouse.
6. Show clear indicators of tax increases and additional amounts owed.
